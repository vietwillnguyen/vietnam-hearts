  <p><strong>Important Note About Our Teaching Location:</strong><br>
  We work with a school in <strong>Binh Thanh, Ho Chi Minh City</strong>, serving underserved communities and children. 
  <strong>For safety reasons, we keep the school's exact location private until a person has signed up for a slot on the schedule</strong>
  Once you're done with the onboarding steps, just <strong>ask in our <a href="{{ INVITE_LINK_DISCORD }}" target="_blank">Discord Group Chat</a></strong> for the location and the day you will come in.</p>
