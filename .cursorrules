# Vietnam Hearts Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
Vietnam Hearts is a volunteer organization focused on teaching English to underprivileged children in Vietnam. The project includes:
- A web application for volunteer management
- A chatbot for handling inquiries and volunteer registration
- Google Sheets integration for class scheduling
- Knowledge base for FAQ responses

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI/Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: TBD
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **APIs**: Google Sheets API, OpenAI/Gemini API, Facebook Messenger API
- **Deployment**: Docker, Railway/Heroku

## Code Style & Standards

### Python
- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `volunteer_info` not `vi`)
- Always include docstrings for classes and functions
- Use logging instead of print statements
- Handle exceptions gracefully with try/except blocks

### API Development
- Use RESTful conventions for endpoints
- Always validate input data
- Return consistent JSON response formats
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Add rate limiting for public endpoints

### Database
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM when possible
- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Include database migrations for schema changes
- Use meaningful table and column names

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Chatbot Development
- Always provide fallback responses for unhandled queries
- Log all user interactions for improvement
- Include confidence scores when using AI responses
- Include source of information in responses
- Provide clear escalation paths to human support
- Support both English and Vietnamese where appropriate

### Google Sheets Integration
- Provide offline fallbacks when sheets are unavailable
- Use batch operations when possible

### Knowledge Base
- Always cite sources in responses
- Include confidence levels for knowledge base matches
- Provide structured data formats (markdown for formatting)
- Keep responses concise but informative

### Security
- Never expose API keys in code
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication for admin endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs

## Response Formatting
- Use clear, helpful error messages
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Format responses consistently (especially for the chatbot)
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include request IDs for debugging

## Testing
- This project uses poetry, use poetry run before commands with dependencies
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test scenarios in pytest that can be parameterized in pytest should be
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- tests for python should be written for pytest in mind.

## Documentation
- Update README.md with setup instructions
- Document all API endpoints
- Include examples for complex functions
- Keep inline comments focused on "why" not "what"
- Update this .cursorrules file as the project evolves

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- When generating code, always include error handling
- Suggest appropriate logging for debugging
- Consider performance implications for database queries
- Recommend security best practices
- Provide examples of proper usage
- Always include type hints and docstrings
- Consider scalability when suggesting solutions

## Common Patterns
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use factories for complex object creation
- Implement proper logging throughout the application
- Use configuration classes for settings management

## Vietnam Hearts Specific Context
- Classes are held in Binh Thanh, Ho Chi Minh City
- Volunteer roles include Teachers, Teaching Assistants, and Non-Teaching roles
- No formal teaching certificate required
- Focus on English education for underprivileged children
- Safety and privacy are priorities (don't expose exact locations publicly)

## When suggesting improvements:
- Consider cost implications (API usage, hosting)
- Think about non-technical team members who need to use admin features
- Prioritize user experience for volunteers
- Consider the Vietnamese context and cultural sensitivity
- Always suggest sustainable, maintainable solutions
